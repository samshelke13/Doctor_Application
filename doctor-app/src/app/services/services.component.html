When the tube reaches the narrowed mitral valve, a balloon device located on the tip of the catheter is quickly inflated. The narrowed or fused mitral valve leaflets are separated and stretched open as the balloon presses against them. This process enhances the functioning of Mitral valve and insures good flow of blood from left auricle to left ventricle.</h2>
